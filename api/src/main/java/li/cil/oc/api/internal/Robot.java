/**
 * This interface allows interaction with robots.
 * <br>
 * It is intended to be used by components when installed in a robot. In that
 * case, the robot in question is the block entity passed to item driver when
 * asked to create the component's environment.
 * <br>
 * A robot's inventory contains component items and items in the actual
 * inventory. The physical layout in the underlying 'real' inventory is as
 * follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Tool</li>
 * <li><code>equipmentInventory.getSizeInventory</code> hot-swappable components.</li>
 * <li><code>mainInventory.getSizeInventory</code> internal inventory slots.</li>
 * <li><code>componentCount</code> hard-wired components.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Note that there may be no hot-swappable (or even built-in) components or
 * no inventory, depending on the configuration of the robot. The hard-wired
 * components cannot be changed (removed/replaced).
 * <br>
 * This interface is <em>not meant to be implemented</em>, just used.
 * <br>
 * Note: the concrete robot block entity classes also implement
 * {@code net.neoforged.neoforge.fluids.capability.IFluidHandler} for
 * NeoForge's fluid system integration, but that interface is not declared
 * here to keep the API loader-independent. Callers that need fluid
 * access should use the NeoForge capability system or
 * {@link li.cil.oc.api.internal.MultiTank#getFluidTank(int)}.
